        <p>
          I grew up living by the beach in a town called
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuibQGBOEIA" target="_blank">Rockaway Beach, Queens</a>. Growing up
          in Rockaway was a lot of fun. My town even had a
          famous amusement park called Rockaway's Playland.

          I was introduced to technology at a very early age. I owned an
          ancient relic known as the
          <a href="https://www.oldcomputr.com/atari-400-1979/" target="_blank">Atari 400</a>.

            class="atari-img" /></a>
        <p>
          I remember typing programs on this thing, most often for 10 minutes
          or longer just to see something as small as a line of color streak
          across the screen for 3 seconds. May sound a bit anticlimatic, but
          for this time it was amazing. If memory serves me correctly I dont
          even believe I was able to save the program.

        <h3 class="sub-section-title">Current Years</h3>
        <p>These days I am slowly trying to put the pieces together to make an entry into the technology space. I have
          enjoyed technology from the days of my childhood. I am sure I would have been a computer wizard long ago if I
          would have continued exploring technology.</p>
